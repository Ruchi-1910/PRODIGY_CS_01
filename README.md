## 🔐 Task-01: Caesar Cipher – Cybersecurity Internship

---

### 📌 Task Objective
The goal of this task was to:

- Create a Python script capable of **encrypting and decrypting user-input text**.
- Accept a **custom message and shift value** from the user.
- Apply the **Caesar Cipher algorithm** to shift letters accordingly and return the output.
- Build understanding of **data confidentiality through basic encryption techniques**.

### 🧠 What is Caesar Cipher?
The **Caesar Cipher** is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.  
It is one of the **earliest and simplest encryption methods**, historically used by **Julius Caesar** to protect military messages.

### 💡 Key Features of the Project
✅ Allows **interactive input** for message and shift value  
✅ Supports both **encryption and decryption** based on user choice  
✅ Handles **uppercase and lowercase letters**, preserving their original case  
✅ Maintains **non-alphabetic characters** (punctuation, numbers) without changes  
✅ Uses **modular arithmetic** to wrap around the alphabet correctly

### 🖥️ How the Program Works
1. The user is prompted to choose between **encryption ('e') or decryption ('d')**.
2. Inputs a **message** to process.
3. Inputs a **shift value** (integer).
4. The program **shifts letters accordingly** to produce the final output.
