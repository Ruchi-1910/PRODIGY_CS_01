🔐 Task-01: Caesar Cipher – Cybersecurity Internship
📌 Task Objective
The goal of this task was to:

Create a Python script capable of encrypting and decrypting user-input text.

Accept a custom message and shift value from the user.

Apply the Caesar Cipher algorithm to shift letters accordingly and return the output.

Build understanding of data confidentiality through basic encryption techniques.

🧠 What is Caesar Cipher?
The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.
It is one of the earliest and simplest encryption methods, historically used by Julius Caesar to protect military messages.

💡 Key Features of the Project
✔️ Allows interactive input for message and shift value
✔️ Supports both encryption and decryption based on user choice
✔️ Handles uppercase and lowercase letters, preserving their original case
✔️ Maintains non-alphabetic characters (punctuation, numbers) without changes
✔️ Uses modular arithmetic to wrap around the alphabet correctly

🖥️ How the Program Works
The user is prompted to choose between encryption ('e') or decryption ('d').

Inputs a message to process.

Inputs a shift value (integer).

The program shifts letters accordingly to produce the final output.
