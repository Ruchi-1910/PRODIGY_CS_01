# PRODIGY_CS_01
This project implements the Caesar Cipher, one of the simplest and most well-known encryption techniques. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt text by shifting characters based on a user-defined key. This helped me understand the basics of string manipulation, character encoding, and simple cryptographic algorithms using Python.
